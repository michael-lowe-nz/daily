Place to say stuff...

**28.6.17**
Start to learn php, silverstripe, CWP, how it all ties together

**4.7.17**
Silverstripe stuff
Linking in sass, js with webpack
Setting up an SS project from scratch
Need to learn how to set up a MySQL db from scratch for an SS project

**5.7.17**
MySQL DB
Creating a class/table in SS
Handling Images in SS
Webscraping with cheerio, looking at other people's code

**9.7.17**
Promise.all catches when any of the promises reject.
Need to find a better way to execute a whole array of promises, regardless of whether they resolve or reject.

**13.7.17**
Need to get better at git stuff, look at leraningGit website
We clone the server-base onto our dev-server, cd into the directory and run composer install
Then with the theme for that particular site, we clone it down locally, and map it to e.g. moeparents/themes/parent-theme.
The core gets mapped straight into moeparents/parent-core

**25.7.17**
AgeGuessAPI, the Heroku instance (dyno) probably isn't the best place to rattle of thousands of promises and https requests of wikipedia pages. Might be best to scrape locally and then upload some sort of postgreSQL dump to the db, rather than running the scraping scripts on the server.
Starting to look into Oauth, need better understanding of what is trying to be achieved. Use JS to direct user to the appropriate route, depending on whether they are 'logged in'. Then, all requests to the API are authenticated, and are only carried out when user has their oAuth 'token'?

**27.7.17**
Composer.json, looking into how the backend for forms works. RESTful API endpoints with Silverstripe
Auth is hard
owl.carousel will take a bit of fiddling to look like it did, but some good css practice

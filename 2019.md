**19.2.19**

It's been a while, so here is sampler of some of the things/all of the things that I have used/worked on:

* Laravel 5.7 PHP Framework
* Using the Laravel ORM, Eloquent
* Unit testing with PHPUnit
* Writing lots of migrations in code, as opposed to Silverstripe where migrations are determined automatically depending on the models you create in the code
* Silverstripe 4 Blocks
* Montoring with Sentry
* Setting up Laravel on an EC2 instance
* AWS RDS, connecting to an EC2, security groups for secure credentials
* AWS SES (Simple Email Service) for sending mail from a Laravel Application
* A11y

**8.5.19**

* AWS API Gateway
* AWS Cloudformation 
* Finally finished [Flex Box Zombies](https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies). I really recommmend this for nailing the flexbox syntax into your head, and to be able to use it way more effectively.
